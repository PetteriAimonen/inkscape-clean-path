An inkscape extension to clean up paths.

Multiple actions can be performed on paths, that do not alter the apperance, but may help other 
extensions and tools to successfully work on a path. Or change paths behaviour according to a users intent.

Possible actions are

* Chain Paths
  Multiple paths or subpaths that end or start at the same point (or very close) are combined into one larger path.

* Remove Duplicates
  Paths or objects that appear in the same place multiple times are reduced to only one.

* Break Apart - Keep holes
  Separates subpaths into individual paths if they do not overlap. 
  Similar to the builtin 'Break Apart' operation from the 'Path' menue, but preserves holes.
